// This file is intentionally left empty as we're using EntidadJpaVenta instead.
// The original SaleJpaEntity.java was trying to use SaleItemJpaEntity, but this class doesn't exist in the infrastructure module.
// We've updated the repository interfaces to use the Spanish-named entity classes, so this file is no longer needed.
